                I saw a stylish house right in the middle of the Norwegian forest in some magazine.
                I thought then that I also want to live in such a house. This dream came true a few
                months ago on a tour of Norway. I am very happy! Thanks, guys!</span></p>

                she was 5 years old. I was worried that it would be difficult for her but everything
                went great. We spent nights in good hotels with excellent breakfasts. My daughter always
                had something to eat, and the nature in Norway fascinated her even more than us!</span></p>
